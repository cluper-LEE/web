The traditional metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure is obtained by growing a

layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) on top of a silicon substrate, commonly by thermal

oxidation and depositing a

layer of metal or polycrystalline silicon (the latter is commonly used).

As the silicon dioxide is a dielectric material, its structure is equivalent to a

planar capacitor, with one of the electrodes replaced by a semiconductor.
