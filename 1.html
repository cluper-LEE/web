    The MOS capacitor structure is the heart of the MOSFET. Consider a MOS capacitor where the silicon base is of p-type.
    If a positive voltage is applied at the gate, holes which are at the surface of the p-type substrate will be repelled by the electric field generated by the voltage
    applied. At first, the holes will simply be repelled and what will remain on the surface will be immobile (negative) atoms of the acceptor type, which creates a
    depletion region on the surface. Remember that a hole is created by an acceptor atom, e.g. Boron, which has one less electron than Silicon.
    One might ask how can holes be repelled if they are actually non-entities? The answer is that what really happens is not that a hole is repelled,
    but electrons are attracted by the positive field, and fill these holes, creating a depletion region where no charge carriers exist because the electron is now
    fixed onto the atom and immobile.

    As the voltage at the gate increases, there will be a point at which the surface above the depletion region will be converted from p-type into n-type,
    as electrons from the bulk area will start to get attracted by the larger electric field. This is known as inversion. The threshold voltage at which this conversion
    happens is one of the most important parameters in a MOSFET.

    In the case of a p-type bulk, inversion happens when the intrinsic energy level at the surface becomes smaller than the Fermi level at the surface. One can see this from
    a band diagram. Remember that the Fermi level defines the type of semiconductor in discussion. If the Fermi level is equal to the Intrinsic level, the semiconductor is of
    intrinsic, or pure type. If the Fermi level lies closer to the conduction band (valence band) then the semiconductor type will be of n-type (p-type). Therefore, when the
    gate voltage is increased in a positive sense (for the given example), this will "bend" the intrinsic energy level band so that it will curve downwards towards the valence
    band. If the Fermi level lies closer to the valence band (for p-type), there will be a point when the Intrinsic level will start to cross the Fermi level and when the
    voltage reaches the threshold voltage, the intrinsic level does cross the Fermi level, and that is what is known as inversion. At that point, the surface of the
    semiconductor is inverted from p-type into n-type. Remember that as said above, if the Fermi level lies above the Intrinsic level, the semiconductor is of n-type,
    therefore at Inversion, when the Intrinsic level reaches and crosses the Fermi level (which lies closer to the valence band), the semiconductor type changes at the
    surface as dictated by the relative positions of the Fermi and Intrinsic energy levels.
